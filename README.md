# MapWeaver

There is a lot of data on the web that is inherently location-based,
but that is presented in a text-based format (lists of addresses, etc).
This repo contains some tools for scraping that data,
finding the latitude/longitude of each location,
and presenting them on an interactive map.

The main thing so far is the [ESDM App](https://field-cady.github.io/mapweaver/esdm).
ESDM is a powerful, fun therapy that teaches autistic children critical social/communication skills.
Unfortunately finding a therapist can be very hard.  This app shows all licensed therapists in the
world and how to contact them, so you can find a provider near you.

A secondary app tracks [PARIS Violation](https://field-cady.github.io/mapweaver/)
of water quality in Washington state.
